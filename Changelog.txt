	- Renamed to match fr0z3nUI addon naming conventions:
		- fr0z3nUI_HearthZone.toc
		- fr0z3nUI_HearthZone.lua
	- SavedVariables updated to `fr0z3nUI_HearthZoneCharDB`.
	- Keeps the macro API `HearthZone:GetZone()`.
	- Includes a one-time migration from older `HearthZone` saved data.

Thanks to the original author, it did pretty much what I wanted it to do.

Just changed 'GetZoneText' to 'GetRealZoneText', oh and the names (sorry).

Probably didn't need to change anything, just like messing with things,
even though it hadn't been updated in 6 years (2018), still worked fine, 
thats why I decided against re-cursing it.

Just messed around with it for my own use, great little addon to begin with, 
hearthstone location needs the zone name, tried a lot of things before coming
across this.  Thought becuase of its last update it wouldn't work, but wrong,
helps that its a pretty basic addon I guess.

Installation
	- Log Out
	- Put the !HearthZone directory in your "[WoWDir]\Interface\Addons\" folder. 
	- Log In, Make sure !HearthZone is enabled
	- Visit an Inkeeper and set your Hearthstone, to initialize the addon.
	- Type '/run HearthZone:GetZone()'
	- A response "Inn Name, Zone Name" should come back.

Inn Examples
	Working											Not Working
		Lions Pride Inn, Elwynn Forest
		Trade District, Stormwind City			
		Mage Quarter, Stormwind City					Pig and Whistle Tavern, Old Town	Not Stormwind City
															  GetZoneText said, Cannals
	
But you get its better than just Lions Pride Inn, well thats a bad example, but some Inn's are not infamous.
