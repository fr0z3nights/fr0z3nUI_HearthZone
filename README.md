# fr0z3nUI HearthZone (Deprecated)

This addon has been merged into **fr0z3nUI AutoOpen (FAO)**.

- Use FAO's options window and open the **Hearth** tab (with **Hearth** + **Macros** sub-tabs).
- HearthZone is kept here only as a legacy / reference addon.

## Install
Prefer installing/enabling **fr0z3nUI_AutoOpen** instead.

If you still enable this legacy addon, behavior and support are not guaranteed.

## Slash Commands / /run snippets
These were for the standalone legacy addon. In FAO, use the **Hearth** tab UI.

## SavedVariables
- Legacy Character DB: `fr0z3nUI_HearthZoneCharDB`

## Notes
- Macro updates are skipped in combat (as required by the WoW UI environment).
